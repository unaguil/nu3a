* Pure software render with:
	* Light support (ambient and spot lights)
	* Textures
	* Basic materials

Examples
--------

1. **Build**

		ant 

2. **Run an example**
	
* Triangle drawing test

		java -cp dist/nu3a-1.0.jar examples.BasicTest
   		
* A more complex scene

		java -cp dist/nu3a-1.0.jar examples.SceneTest
 
	* Press L to set light on/off
 	* Use + and - to increase or reduce the spot light angle
 	* Mouse click to select an object and show its bounding box
 	* Use cursors to move the nearest box
